    <section id="overview"><title>Overview</title>


        <p>Helion Development Platform version 1.2 adds tools for creating instances of Windows
                Server 2012 R2 to an HPE Helion <tm tmtype="reg">OpenStack</tm> environment, and
                Visual Studio components for deploying .NET HTTP-based applications to those server
                instances. Benefits of Windows/.NET support include:</p>
<ul>
<li> Organizations can run their .NET server applications in the same HPE Helion OpenStack
                    environment as their Linux applications.</li>
    <li> A consistent tooling experience for deploying Windows and Linux applications: The same 
        <xref href="windows_tools_guide.dita#windows_tools/helion" type="section">application deployment tools</xref> can be used for 
        both Windows and Linux deployments.</li>
    <li> Additional developer tools, including an SDK for programmatic access to services, and a 
        <xref href="windows_tools_guide.dita#windows_tools/cloudfoundryextensions">Visual Studio extension</xref> for 
        deploying and managing applications.</li>
    <li> Feature-rich application sandboxing, including memory and CPU management, and application isolation. This allows applications to coexist within a single 
        ALS cluster, saving the overhead of running 
        a separate operating system for each application.</li>
    <li> Support for creating Windows instances that include Microsoft SQL Server Express. </li>
    <li> Integrated buildpack support for building applications with dependencies and services.</li>
</ul>
        
        <p>Windows and .NET support is enabled by adding this functionality to an existing Helion Development Platform 1.2 installation.</p>

        <p>For the 1.2 release, we support creating the following types of instances:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Windows Server 2012 R2 with DEA (Droplet Execution Agent) role</li>
    <li>Windows Server 2012 R2 with SQL Server 2012 Express</li>
    <li>Windows Server 2012 R2 with SQL Server 2014 Express</li>
</ul>
        <p>Helion Development Platform treats deployment of .NET applications in the same way as
                Linux applications (such as Java or PHP appplications). .NET applications require a
                    buildpack to
                specify the dependencies and <xref href="windows_adding_services.dita#topic3869" type="section"  
                    >services</xref> that can be bound to the application. .NET applications are
                deployed into a sandbox environment similar to Warden in Cloud Foundry. </p>
        </section>
    <section id="apps"><title>Supported .NET Application Types</title>

        <p>Helion Development Platform supports HTTP-based applications, including ASP.NET and WCF. Design considerations for Windows DEA applications are the 
            same as for 
            <xref format="html" scope="external" href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/prepare-to-deploy.html">Cloud Foundry</xref> 
            applications.</p> 

        <p>Helion Development Platform also provides an integrated IIS buildpack which supports the following technologies:</p>
<ul>
    <li> IIS 8 </li>
    <li> .NET 2.0-4.5.2</li>
    <li> ASP.NET Web Forms</li>
    <li> ASP.NET WebAPI v1 and v2</li>
    <li> ASP.NET MVC 2 through 5 with Entity Framework 6</li>
    <li> ASP.NET SignalR</li>
    <li> WCF services</li>
</ul>
        </section>
    <section id="sql"><title>SQL Server Support</title>


        <p>The Helion Development Platform 1.2 supports SQL Server Express 2012 and SQL Server Express 2014. SQL Server support is enabled by creating a 
            SQL Server service using the SQL Server broker. 
            Each application that binds to the SQL Server service will create a new database and service credentials. The service credentials get created 
            and can be accessed either from the 
            <codeph>web.config</codeph> file, or programmatically through the <codeph>VCAP_SERVICES</codeph> environment variable.</p>
        </section>
    <section id="tools"><title>Windows Tools </title>

        <p>In order to run .NET framework applications, Helion Development Platform requires that Windows DEA nodes be deployed. The tools used to 
            create and deploy Windows DEA nodes, and to deploy 
            .NET Framework applications, include the following:</p>
        </section>

        <ul>
            <li>Cloud Foundry Extensions: This Visual Studio extension performs simple management tasks such as starting or stopping an application, 
                deleting a service, or renaming a route.</li>
            <li>Cloud Foundry MSBuild tasks: These MSBuild processes allow you to build and deploy .NET applications as part of the usual build process 
                for your application.</li>
            <li>Cloud Foundry .NET SDK: These libraries allow you to programmatically interact with the Cloud Foundry APIs.</li>
        </ul>

</ul>
        </section>
    <section id="licensing"><title>Windows Instance Licensing</title>
        <p>You will need to provide your own Windows licensing for use with Windows instances; Microsoft's licensing requires customers to create their own images using their own 
            licensed software. During 
            image creation, temporary instances of Windows Server are created, so a volume license is required.</p> 

        <p>Windows Server licensing for Windows DEAs and Windows SQL Server instances consists of two components:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Licensing agreements. These are paid contracts with Microsoft, which include the legal
                    right to run a software package and support agreements. Since HPE Helion
                    OpenStack is a <xref format="html" scope="external"
                        href="http://www.windowsservercatalog.com/svvp.aspx">certified SSVP
                        provider</xref>, customers can use Microsoft support with their own
                    licensing agreements.</li> 
        <li>Activation. Your Windows instances can be activated by using your KVM server, or by connecting to the Windows instance directly using Remote Desktop, and providing 
            product keys manually.</li>
</ul>
        <p>For more information on licensing Windows Server, see 
            <xref format="html" scope="external" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/product-licensing/windows-server-2012-r2.aspx">Windows Server 2012 Volume Licensing</xref>, 
            or contact your 
            Microsoft licensing representative.</p>
