<p>The Management Console is a web interface for Application Lifecycle Service (ALS). Using the same API as the Helion CLI client, it provides access to a subset of features for deploying, scaling, and configuring applications as well as monitoring quota usage, and viewing logs.</p>
<p>The interface differs for Admin and non-Admin users. The features described below are available and visible to end users. For information on the Management Console view for Admins, see the <xref href="../../admin/console/console_index.dita" >Console Admin Guide</xref>.</p>

<p>The top-level page of the Management Console displays quick links to the most commonly used resources:</p>

            format="dita">Sample Applications</xref>.</li>
<li>
          <b>Organizations Membership</b>: Link to the end user view of the <xref
            href="#topic8844/welcome" format="dita">Organizations</xref> page.</li>
<li>
<b>Account Details</b>: Shows the account details of the current user. Also accessible from the drop down list at the top left.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="app-list"> <title>Applications List</title>
<p>The Applications list is accessible from the top menu. It shows all applications deployed under the current user's Organizations.</p>
<p>The list shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the application name</li>
<li>the Organization it belongs to</li>
<li>the Space it was deployed to</li>
<li>the Description field</li>
<li>its current state (STARTED or STOPPED)</li>
<li>its staging state (STAGED or FAILED)</li>
<li>Application Access (whether Application SSO is enabled)</li>
</ul>
<p>The list can be sorted by name or state, and filtered by:</p>
<ul>
<li>State</li>
<li>Staging State</li>
<li>Application Access</li>
<li>Restart Required</li>
</ul>
<p>The list includes applications deployed to all Spaces in the current user's Organizations, even those for which the user may not have access. Applications in such Spaces are visible, but no changes can be made to them.</p>
<p>Clicking on the application name opens its Application View.</p>
</section>
<section id="application-view"> <title>Application View</title>
<p>The top navigation of the Application view gives the name and status of the application followed by its organization / space.</p>
<p>This view also includes the following <b>Tabs</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Summary</b>: General information about the app including its description (optional), which buildpack it uses, when it was created, and when it was last modified. The application state will appear in parentheses beside the application name, and will be one of the following:

<ul>
<li>
<b>Staging</b>: currently staging the application droplet.</li>
<li>
<b>Staging Failed. Check Logs</b>: staging of application droplet has failed</li>
<li>
<b>Online</b>: successfully staged as a droplet and application instances are running</li>
<li>
<b>Flapping</b>: successfully staged as a droplet and application instances are running, but 1 or more instances are flapping (see below)</li>
<li>
<b>Down</b>: successfully staged as a droplet and application instances have been created, but all instances are down. This state will typically not be seen as any one instance will only be down for a short period of time before starting or being removed.</li>
<li>
<b>Offline</b>: successfully staged the application droplet, but no application instances have been created and started.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>Timeline</b>: A real-time stream of events and discussions relevant to the Application. Events in the application's history appear here as notifications which can be commented on by members of the Space.</li>
<li>
<b>App Versions</b>: A rolling list of code and setting changes to an application. Clicking Rollback to this version for any listed version reverts the application to the selected version's state and creates a new version. </li>
<li>
<b>Environment Variables</b>: Environment variables that have been explicitly set in the application container (via application config, client commands, or this interface). Default variables, those set by the application framework, or those added by the system for data services are excluded from this view.</li>
<li>
<b>Settings</b>: The number of application instances, disk space, and memory allotment used by the application. This usage counts against the organization's quota.</li>
