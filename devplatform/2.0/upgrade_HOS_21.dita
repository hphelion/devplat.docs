  <title>HPE Helion 2.0 Development Platform: Upgrading HPE Helion <tm tmtype="reg">OpenStack</tm> to
    Version 2.1</title>
  <body>
    <p>When upgrading HPE Helion OpenStack from version 2.0 to 2.1, shutting down the virtual
      machines which run the control plane will also affect the services that make up the HPE Helion
      Development Platform. </p>
    <p>Perform these additional steps to safely shut down these specific services prior to upgrading
      and then to restart them after the upgrade is complete.</p>
