  <title>HPE Helion Development Platform 2.0: Installation Overview</title>
  <body>
    <section>
      <p>These instructions are for installing the HPE Helion Development Platform on an HPE Helion
          <tm tmtype="reg">OpenStack</tm> deployment. The instructions for <xref
          href="http://www.hp.com/go/cloudsystem/docs" format="html" scope="external">installing on
          an HPE Helion CloudSystem deployment</xref> are different.</p>
      <p>The HPE Helion Development Platform is made up of several services. Each of these services
        can be installed independently. You do not have to install them in any particular order.</p>
      <p>Services are installed using the HDP Installer, also known as HDPI. This tool is a plugin
        for the python-openstackclient (OSC). You must download and set up the HDPI before
        installing any services.</p>
      <p>During installation, the HDPI refers to a configuration file named
          <codeph>clouds.yaml</codeph> for the parameters it needs. There is only one
          <codeph>clouds.yaml</codeph> file, which you will create at
          <codeph>~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml</codeph>.  Each section within that file contains
        parameters required to install a service. Since each service can be installed separately,
        you can populate the whole file at once, or only one section at a time, as you prefer, as
        long as the information is present before you attempt installation.</p>
      <p>During installation, the required files will be downloaded from the Helion Download Network
        (HDN). Depending on network traffic, this may take up to 90 minutes for a single package.
        Direct download may not be possible if your HPE Helion OpenStack lifecycle manager
        (previously known as the deployer node), is behind significant layers of security. To avoid
        possible delay, interruption, or just for convenience, you can download the files to
        portable storage media before beginning the installation process. If the installer finds the
        files already in the appropriate location, it will not download them again.</p>

      <title>General Installation Procedure</title>
      <p>You do not have to install all available services at the same time.</p>
   <ol>
        <li>(optional) <xref href="install_offline.dita">Download the installation files</xref> from
          the Helion Download Network (HDN) and, if necessary, copy them to the correct
          location.</li>
        <li>Ensure all <xref href="devplatform_install_prereq.dita">prerequisites are
            satisfied</xref>: check the environmental configuration, gather required information,
          and verify required connectivity.</li>
        <li>Download and <xref href="devplatform_install_platform.dita">set up the HDPI</xref>.
          During this process, you will create and minimally populate the
            <codeph>clouds.yaml</codeph> file.</li>
        <li>Populate the <codeph>clouds.yaml</codeph> file with the information required for the
          next service you intend to install.</li>
        <li>Using the HDPI, install a service.<ul id="ul_otm_sbb_h5">
